# Authelia

[Authelia](https://www.authelia.com/) is an open-source authentication and authorization providing 2-factor authentication and single sign-on (SSO) for your applications. It acts as a companion of reverse proxies by handling authentication and authorization requests.

This chart bootstraps a deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager. This application depends on [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [Redis](https://redis.io/), which can be installed as part of this catalog.

### TODO:
Move the redis and mongo out of deployments and use subcharts.
